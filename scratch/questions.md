# GAM-6: Prototype belief-to-strategy comparison

## Directive

- 2026-07-18: Acknowledged the current directive version (v3) with the
  compatible release binary
  (`LF_HOME=/Users/jack/.lf LF_BIN=/Users/jack/src/loopflow/target/release/lf
  /Users/jack/src/loopflow/target/release/lf`, `lf 0.11.3`,
  `LF_WAVE_ID=game`): `GAM-6 incorporated directive v3`
  (`current_directive_version` 3, `incorporated_directive_version` 3;
  receipt `dir_8c130eaed599478e91294ae3a619455f`). PR #139 (belief-conditioned
  system architecture) was integrated from `origin/main` as the execution-plan
  context via `lf rebase --manual origin/main` (reset-to-base; scratch restored
  from the `.lf/tmp/scratch-stash` snapshot). The directive text confirms:
  preserve the completed kickoff design and finish normally; do not redo
  research.

## Blockers (reported once, proceeding inline)

- 2026-07-17: `lf task acknowledge GAM-6 --directive 1` failed — the Loopflow
  registry on this machine was stale (`lf 0.11.3` vs a newer divergent local
  build; `lf doctor` reported migration `0.11.029_ci_incident_repaired_head`
  unknown) and the ambient `LF_WAVE_ID` pointed at a wave no longer in the
  registry. Resolved 2026-07-17: the compatible release binary
  (`LF_HOME=/Users/jack/.lf LF_BIN=/Users/jack/src/loopflow/target/release/lf
  /Users/jack/src/loopflow/target/release/lf`, `lf 0.11.3`, migrations
  applied/known both `0.11.029_ci_incident_repaired_head`) with
  `LF_WAVE_ID=game` recorded `GAM-6 incorporated directive v3`
  (`current_directive_version` 3, `incorporated_directive_version` advanced).
  No outstanding registry blocker. Re-confirmed 2026-07-18 (see Directive).

## Assumptions (executive decisions, correctable in review)

- The two belief scenarios are modeled as two `StudyLandmark` rows at the same
  `erd1` decision inside one `StudyArtifact`, each with real flat-MC evidence
  under a disjoint seed family. The existing `StudyArtifact` contract permits
  this (no duplicate-decision-id check). A thin `scenarios` metadata array
  carries the prototype's presentation layer (labels, descriptions, inferred
  ranges) without touching the Rust-owned schema.
- The "inferred starting range" is a concise, honest, pinned text
  characterization per scenario — not an interactive range editor (the
  directive forbids generic range tooling).
- The live play surface loads the fixture's pinned completed-match decision as
  the demonstration advice surface beside the ActionPanel. The live frame
  during play has no `erd1` address yet (the canonical replay finalizes at
  game close), so live-address advice is a future GAM-4 integration point via
  the `onRequestAdvice` seam.
- The fork/Retry/return UI is out of scope (GAM-4's substrate, not yet
  publishable). The Study-mode component is advisory + comparison only.
- The shared action vocabulary is the frame's legacy `offers` (the live UI and
  the existing fixture already use it); the structured offer surface at the
  forked decision exposes only `pass_priority` and is not the vocabulary here.
- PR #139 deliberately cleared stale scratch notes from prior merged PRs
  (`scratch/provide-exact-study-fork-and-2.md` and the pre-GAM-6
  `questions.md`); the rebase respects that cleanup. Those files survive only
  in the `.lf/tmp/scratch-stash` rebase snapshot.
- 2026-07-18: the current engine
  (`managym/_managym.cpython-312-darwin.so`, 2026-07-17) reproduces the pinned
  decision-6 structure (ordinal 6, revision 6, prompt 7, two offers:
  play_land + pass_priority) but its frame content drifted from the frozen
  `study-curated-decision.json` fixture (frame_hash `8ac9a4a7...` vs frozen
  `f714ccaf...`; canonical replay hash `e846d348...` vs frozen
  `692f3ae1...`). The advice fixture therefore pins to the CURRENT engine's
  canonical identity so its frame, erd1 address, and flat-MC evidence are all
  real and self-consistent. The frozen study fixture is left untouched (out of
  scope). The de-risked flat-MC numbers reproduce exactly on the current
  engine: scenario A policy `[0.75, 0.25]`, scenario B `[0.6875, 0.3125]`
  with value flipping toward Pass and favorable `[0/16, 5/16]` for B.
