## Question

Does the current deterministic multi-world PUCT Teacher-1 produce strong,
stable, legal, viewer-safe, replayable, and affordable root visit/value targets
at budgets 8, 32, and 128, such that a three-seed distillation comparison is
warranted?

This is the smallest experiment not already owned by the live Teacher-0 run. It
evaluates the Teacher-1 substrate landed in PR #106 and uses the eventual
Teacher-0 result only as a frozen control after that run reaches a terminal
state. It generates no student shards or checkpoints.

## Evidence and assumptions

Evidence-backed on the pre-registration branch:

- PRs #105, #106, and #108 are merged; Teacher-0, deterministic PUCT
  Teacher-1, and resumable shard generation exist on current main.
- Teacher-1 emits seeded root visits, Q values, root value, node/depth cost, and
  selected action without mutating the authoritative root; focused tests cover
  these invariants.
- No Teacher-1 control lock or bounded 8/32/128 result is checked in. Therefore
  no quality, latency, competency, calibration, or distillation claim follows
  from this document.

Assumptions frozen before results:

- the live recovery will eventually produce a terminal manifest and the
  preselected `policy_value` checkpoint; if it does not, the control lock
  remains impossible and this runner stays blocked;
- the declared Apple M4 Max host remains the evaluation surface;
- 48 games provide a bounded admission signal, not seed-level method evidence
  equivalent to three independently trained policies.

## Pre-run review amendment (2026-07-16)

Before any control lock was created or Teacher-1 gate was executed, parent
review required the admission boundary to reject foreign-host calibration and
non-finite or negative latency measurements. The runner now binds the contract,
current runtime, control lock, and calibration artifact to the same host
identity; validates both measured p50 values and their relative gap; and applies
the contract's `max_realized_p50_gap` rather than a duplicated threshold. The
contract's pinned `pilot_source_sha256` was updated to the resulting reviewed
runner. No matchup, seed, budget, prediction, quality gate, or continuation
branch changed, and this amendment supplies no Teacher-1 result or Project KR
2-5 evidence.

A second pre-run review found that architecture plus software identity was not
enough to prove the declared Apple M4 Max host, and that the calibration's
reported relative gap was trusted instead of recomputed. The lock boundary now
binds `host.chip` to the current `machdep.cpu.brand_string` (with the same
processor fallback used by the branching benchmark), requires a positive
Teacher-1 p50 denominator, derives `abs(flat_p50 - teacher_p50) / teacher_p50`,
rejects any inconsistent reported gap, and applies the contract threshold to
that derived value. This change also occurred before any control lock or
Teacher-1 run and does not alter the experiment or authorize training.

## Frozen contract

The machine-readable source of truth is
`experiments/contracts/w2-234-teacher1-pilot-v1.json`. It pins:

- world `w2`, complete observation shapes, action/observation/protocol hashes,
  engine source and binary hashes, content digest, and the symmetric
  `INTERACTIVE_DECK` matchup;
- Teacher-1 budgets 8/32/128 total traversals, four worlds, `c_puct=1.5`,
  uniform priors, random terminal leaves, and a 2,000-step cap;
- 48 seat-balanced games per matchup cell, split without expansion into three
  independently reported 16-game blocks at exact seeds 1197, 1419, and 1887;
- 100 runs per competency cell, 192 stability roots searched at the exact
  common-random-number seeds 2197001/2197002/2197003, and four replay-audit
  games;
- eight predeclared audit roots—decision 0 and decision 8 in each audit
  game—whose MCTS action, visits, Q values, root value, and tree metadata must
  reproduce exactly;
- separate `random`, `scripted`, `search`, and `checkpoint` opponent classes;
- the Apple M4 Max host, four-worker limit, 8 wall-hour / 32 core-hour gate,
  2 GiB artifact cap, seeds, predictions, hard gates, and next branches;
- future paired training seeds 197, 419, and 887. No training is authorized by
  this slice.

The Teacher-0 control is matched by measured p50 decision latency, not by the
ambiguous `sims` spelling: Teacher-0 counts playouts per legal action while
Teacher-1 counts total tree traversals across worlds. Each mapping must be
within 10% on the same host and is immutable once its control lock is checked
in. The checkpoint control is the recovery's `policy_value` arm, selected
before its result is read and played by deterministic argmax; the lock rejects
any substituted arm.

## Pre-registered predictions and gates

The high-budget teacher must pass every integrity and quality condition:

1. zero illegal commands, legal-mask/offer mismatches, non-finite or
   out-of-range targets, authoritative-root mutations, private-hand leaks,
   replay frame/command/outcome mismatches, missing sampled roots, or exact
   sampled-search action/visit/Q/root-value mismatches;
2. at least 55% against `t1-8-w4`, at least 55% against the frozen policy-only
   checkpoint, and at least 80% against random;
3. at least 70% repeated-search top-action agreement and at most 0.10 median
   Jensen-Shannon divergence at 128 traversals;
4. strictly increasing mean node count and mean maximum depth from 8 to 128;
5. at least 20% correct on one of S1, S2, or S5 and no S1-S5 result more than
   10 points below random;
6. at most 500 ms p95, at least two labels/second/worker, below 0.1%
   playout-cap hits, and a realized p50 gap within 10% for every matched-wall
   Teacher-0 cell.

Every matchup cell reports all three 16-game blocks and their fixed 48-game
aggregate. The blocks are independent evaluation/search seeds and reuse the
same seed identities across cells for paired comparisons; they do not pretend
that game blocks are independent training seeds.

Root-value Brier score, ten-bin ECE, and reliability bins against the played
terminal outcome are reported as diagnostics, not hard gates. The root value
estimates random-leaf continuation; terminal play follows the teacher, so
calling the former a calibrated outcome target would overstate the evidence.

If every gate passes, the next serial experiment freezes `t1-128-w4` and runs
the matched chosen-action versus visit-distribution comparison at all three
training seeds. Any failure takes the named branch in the contract; no result
authorizes post-hoc target temperature, pruning, capacity, or optimizer tuning.

## Commands

### Delivery owner and authorization boundary

The sole delivery owner is Linear Task **W2-234**, continuing in Task Session
`ts_fdbcddcc86054c7bb5e63eca81393f29`. PR #114 is already merged construction
evidence: GitHub head `67816b57ce713375a272214dc2282821b0a7769d` was settled
once as commit `4b18eaf06be12b83e34d631e7be278f2565a2223` and must not be
landed again.

On 2026-07-16 this owner reran the merged non-training readiness boundary. The
runtime fingerprint command below reproduced the contract-pinned ABI, engine,
content, matchup, and pilot-source identities. Invoking the recorded
`--stage teacher-gate` command with the absent control lock then failed closed
before creating its output directory or performing search, gameplay,
admission, distillation, or student training. The focused merged construction
suite remains the proportional CI command for this boundary.

The exact gated next command remains:

```bash
uv run experiments/runners/run_teacher1_pilot.py \
  --contract experiments/contracts/w2-234-teacher1-pilot-v1.json \
  --control-lock experiments/contracts/w2-234-teacher1-control-lock-v1.json \
  --stage teacher-gate \
  --out-dir .runs/w2-234-teacher1-pilot-v1
```

This command is recorded for continuity, not authorized now. W2-234 may execute
it only after a later controlling directive explicitly permits admission and
after all of these gates hold: the live 3,000-game Teacher-0 recovery manifest
is terminal, its exact `policy_value` checkpoint is frozen by SHA-256,
same-host latency calibration exists, and the separately reviewed control lock
is checked in. Until then, the generator and all of its artifacts are
read-only external dependencies; Teacher-1 admission, distillation, and both
policy-only and joint policy/value student training are forbidden. This
readiness receipt supplies no Project KR 2-5 evidence.

Inspect the frozen runtime before the control lock exists:

```bash
uv run experiments/runners/run_teacher1_pilot.py --print-runtime
```

After the terminal recovery and calibration artifacts have been hashed into
`experiments/contracts/w2-234-teacher1-control-lock-v1.json`, run or resume the
admission gate:

```bash
uv run experiments/runners/run_teacher1_pilot.py \
  --contract experiments/contracts/w2-234-teacher1-pilot-v1.json \
  --control-lock experiments/contracts/w2-234-teacher1-control-lock-v1.json \
  --stage teacher-gate \
  --out-dir .runs/w2-234-teacher1-pilot-v1
```

Independently replay the authoritative audit from a completed run:

```bash
uv run experiments/runners/run_teacher1_pilot.py \
  --contract experiments/contracts/w2-234-teacher1-pilot-v1.json \
  --verify .runs/w2-234-teacher1-pilot-v1
```

Until the control lock exists and validates, `--stage teacher-gate` fails
closed before creating a run directory or doing search work. This is deliberate:
the live recovery result may supply a control, but it cannot influence these
predictions or gates.

## Cap impact of the review revision

The seed-block revision adds no games: each cell remains 48 games, now 3 × 16.
It reloads player/control state three times per cell instead of once, a bounded
initialization overhead that is included in measured wall time. Exact sampled
search replay adds eight `t1-128-w4` searches—1,024 total PUCT traversals—and no
new trajectories. The stability workload remains 192 roots × 3 repeats × 3
budgets; only its formerly derived seeds are now explicit. The 8 wall-hour,
32 core-hour, and 2 GiB caps are unchanged and cumulative across resumes.
