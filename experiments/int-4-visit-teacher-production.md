# INT-4 Production Visit-Teacher Iteration

> **Status on 2026-07-17: fail-closed harness ready; production not run.**

The production-only runner and additive contract now bind the landed INT-4
engineering substrate to the registered 256-game dataset, four student arms at
seeds 197/419/887, 48-game arena cells, exact frozen Teacher-0 controls,
same-host flat-MC calibration, S1-S5 competencies, resource receipts, replay,
Study validation, and an explicit admission decision.

This is durable implementation progress, not production evidence. Neither
registered Teacher-0 checkpoint is present in the repository `.runs` cache:

- `policy_only` — `3bfedccf5aa6ed7621d99284ea8cea3975d8b195cecf6426d37dd7abc812c978`
- `policy_value` — `92ced7abb31bc68298b48cc08ed7eb57f3dde50295a22d50ea2fe32f7e359176`

The command rejects a missing path, wrong hash, wrong arm, incompatible model,
or runtime/source identity before it creates a production run directory. The
controls must not be retrained, reconstructed, ported, or substituted.

## Run and verify

```bash
uv run experiments/runners/run_visit_teacher_production.py \
  --contract experiments/contracts/int-4-visit-teacher-iteration-v1.json \
  --production-contract experiments/contracts/int-4-visit-teacher-production-v1.json \
  --policy-only-control /absolute/path/to/frozen-policy-only.pt \
  --policy-value-control /absolute/path/to/frozen-policy-value.pt \
  --out-dir .runs/int-4-visit-teacher-production-v1

uv run experiments/runners/run_visit_teacher_production.py \
  --contract experiments/contracts/int-4-visit-teacher-iteration-v1.json \
  --production-contract experiments/contracts/int-4-visit-teacher-production-v1.json \
  --policy-only-control /absolute/path/to/frozen-policy-only.pt \
  --policy-value-control /absolute/path/to/frozen-policy-value.pt \
  --out-dir .runs/int-4-visit-teacher-production-v1 \
  --verify
```

The independent verifier performs no training or evaluation. It rehashes all
contracts, controls, source/runtime identities, jobs, shards, checkpoints, and
Study evidence; exactly replays the sampled trajectories and searches; and
recomputes the teacher and admission gates from immutable results.

Fresh verification on 2026-07-17:

- 53 focused Python tests passed through `uv`;
- the complete debug `managym` Cargo suite passed, including 12/12 search
  state contract tests and 11/11 search tests;
- PR #133's smoke independently replayed all 175 decisions and its sampled
  search root with zero mismatches or private-card exposures, then revalidated
  the same Study artifact in Python and Rust;
- a missing-control preflight left no production run directory.

INT-4 remains open. The next admissible evidence begins only when both exact
control files are available and the registered production command completes
within its 16 wall-hour, 64 core-hour, four-worker, and 4 GiB caps.
