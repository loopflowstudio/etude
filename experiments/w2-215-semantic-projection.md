## Encoding size

The immutable catalog contains 31 definitions, 37 programs, 2,088 typed
tokens, and four definition-reference edges. It occupies 13,116 bytes ragged
or 27,384 bytes after deterministic catalog padding. Per visible object,
semantic content is 53 tokens at p50, 95 at p95, and 148 at maximum.

## Latency and throughput

Cold schema/IR validation, tokenization, and exact ContentPack binding took
1.909 ms. Hot viewer projection latency was 7.167 microseconds at p50 and
11.250 microseconds at p95; the maximum observed sample was 296.291
microseconds.

| Batch size | Batch-only observations/s | Encode + batch observations/s | Encode + batch tokens/s |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 96,193 | 46,688 | 114,203,792 |
| 32 | 399,693 | 74,811 | 182,995,765 |
| 256 | 456,816 | 76,261 | 186,543,109 |

The largest measured 256-observation ragged object batch occupied 253,602
bytes and its padded form occupied 334,080 bytes. Python traced peak allocation
was 1,003,313 bytes. Process RSS increased by 819,200 bytes during the isolated
memory pass; process peak RSS was 268,550,144 bytes.

## Correctness boundary

All 176,802 visible object bindings were admitted. The benchmark recorded zero
projection failures, zero unadmitted visible objects, and zero valid opaque
identity features in `semantic_only` mode. Focused tests separately prove
deterministic encoding and masking, exact environment ContentPack binding,
hidden-state determinization safety, structural recombination, definition-edge
integrity, artifact-header rejection, and unknown schema/opcode rejection.

This task does not interpret semantic IR in the rules engine, alter the fixed
observation/action ABI, train a semantic encoder or decoder, or claim held-out
transfer.
